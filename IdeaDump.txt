ScriptableObjects for different features or levels? Research how this would work!

Maybe stick to a color scheme - blocks with higher damage level have consistent color

Use circular colliders on blocks? 

Show points overall and points per level. 
Points per level get added to points overall after the level is cleared.
Show CLEARED text and maybe sound (someone saying CLEARED!)
After each level offer to retry the level or restart everything.

Ideas for blocks and paddles:
- secret block that ends the level
- stationary paddle that gives you speed
- stationary paddle that slows you down
- moving paddle (NPC) that gives you crazy points, then disappears
- stationary paddle that makes the ball transparent for some time
- block that makes the paddle/ball smaller
- block that makes the paddle wider
- (unbreakable?) block that rotates the camera slowly 360 once or twice

Ideas for levels:
- two paddles, one up, one down, controlled at the same time, one ball
- two paddles, two balls
- four paddles, one ball
- four paddles, two balls
- time challenge
- paddle that shrinks over time
- paddle that shrinks every time you hit it
- slow ball - fast ball
- blocks that hide behind other blocks
- snow or confetti lower visibility
- camera is swinging?
